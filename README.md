Thanks to Tanner Netterville for his efforts on [Pynliner](https://github.com/rennat/pynliner).

Thanks to Thomas Yip for his hard work on the soupselect module included in this
(specifically on writing extensive unit tests for most of the functionality found in CSS2).
Without his efforts only the most basic selectors would work.
